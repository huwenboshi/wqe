SoCal: supervised genotype calling via ellipsoid
separation for Affymetrix SNP microarray
Huwenbo Shi (603-778-363) shihuwenbo@ucla.edu

ABSTRACT
In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for
Affymetrix SNP microarray. For each SNP, SoCal first efficiently identify ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype from reference genotype calls, and
then uses these regions to classify future SNPs into different genotypes. Using only a small portion of training genotype calls from the HapMap Project,
SoCal achieves an accuracy of 97.5% during validation.

1 Introduction
Accurate genotyping of SNPs is essential to discovering true signals in association
studies. Although next generation sequencing technology provides cheap whole-genome
sequences for genotyping SNPs, SNP microarray is still a cost-effective genotyping technology for many specific association studies. In an Affymetrix SNP microarray, oligonucleotide probes are used to match and bind DNA fragments containing biallelic SNPs.
Then a fluorescence scanner scans the microarray to quantify perfect match and mismatch of these fragments. Most genotype calling procedures for SNP microarray consists
of two steps. In the first step, raw information from microarray is summarized to obtain
the intensities, θA and θB , of the two alleles, denoted by A and B, of each SNP. In
the second step, SNPs are classified into genotype AA, AB, or BB based on the allele
intensities they generate. The focus of this article is on the second step of the genotype
calling procedure—genotype calling using summarized allele intensities.
For a specific SNP, if a sample has genotype AA or BB, the allele intensity, θA or
θB , will be higher respectively. If a sample has genotype AB, the intensities, θA and θB ,
will be similar. If one plots logpθA q versus logpθB q of a SNP for a number of samples,
normally 3 ellipsoidal clusters can be observed, one for each genotype, as shown in
Figure 1. Many genotype calling algorithms use model-based unsupervised clustering to
identify these clusters and then assign genotypes to each cluster. Although these methods
are applicable to a wide range of microarrays, they don’t take advantage of genotype calls
that are already available. Also, these methods use the EM algorithm to estimate model
parameters, which is sensitive to starting parameters and slow to converge. To utilize
reference genotype calls, Rabbee et al. proposed the RLMM algorithm, a supervised

INTRODUCTION

genotype calling method that uses reference genotype calls to form decision regions by
fitting bivariate Gaussian distributions on observed allele intensities for each genotype.
These Gaussian decision regions are then used to call SNPs with unknown genotype.
However, fitting a Gaussian distribution is known to be sensitive to outliers, which, for
SNP microarrays, can be caused by genomic structural variations.

In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for Affymetrix
SNP microarrays. Instead of fitting Gaussian distributions on allele intensities with reference genotype calls, SoCal efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype
of a SNP by solving a conic programming problem. SoCal can control the effect of
outliers by assigning different weights to each of the criteria for finding the ellipsoids—
separation ratio, ellipsoid volume, and number of enclosed points. After SoCal finds the
ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype of a SNP, it uses them to call the same
SNP with unknown genotype.
Using reference genotype calls from the HapMap Project as training and validation
data, SoCal achieved 99.71% accuracy at a call rate of 95% during leave-one-out crossvalidation. Furthermore, SoCal shows more robustness than the RLMM method when
there are outliers in the training data.

METHODS

2 Methods
2.1 Overview of SoCal’s genotype calling procedure
SNP allele intensities are first summarized from raw microarray data using SNPRMA,
which removes non-biological effect from the data. After this step, SoCal calls genotypes
in two steps. In the first step, SoCal finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each of the
genotype of a SNP using reference genotype calls. In the second step, SoCal classifies
SNPs with unknown genotypes using minimum distance classification.

2.2 Pattern separation by ellipsoid
An ellipsoid E Ď ❘n can be expressed as E “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cqT Epx ´ cq ď 1u, where
c is the center of the ellipsoid, and E a positive definite matrix denoting the shape and
orientation of the ellipsoid. Let tai u be the points to be included in an ellipsoid, and
tbj u be the points to be excluded, the problem of ellipsoidal separation is to find c and
E such that pai ´ cqT Epai ´ cq ď 1 @i and pbj ´ cqT Epbj ´ cq ą 1 @j.

2.3 Forming ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype
Let G “ tAA, AB, BBu be the set of genotypes of a SNP, and JAA , JAB , JBB the
index set of samples with the corresponding genotype. Let X “ tplogpθA q, logpθB qqi |i “
1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , |JAA | ` |JAB | ` |JBB |u be the set of log transformed allele intensities of all the
samples, and XAA “ txj |xj P X, j P JAA u, XAB “ txj |xj P X, j P JAB u, XBB “
txj |xj P X, j P JBB u the set of log transformed allele intensities from samples having
the corresponding genotype.
To find the ellipsoid that includes XAA and excludes XAB Y XBB , one sets tai u “
XAA and tbj u “ XAB Y XBB , and solves the following conic programming problem. The
derivation of the problem formulation is largely followed from [7]. For the sake of space,
detailed derivation of the problem formulation is not presented here.

If a SNP has moderate minor allele frequency (MAF), the genotype clusters of that
SNP are well defined, and SoCal obtains three ellipsoidal decision regions for that SNP,
one for each genotype (Figure 2a). However, if a SNP has lower MAF, some genotype
cluster may not be well defined. For these SNPs, SoCal estimates the ellipsoid for the
missing genotype cluster using the ellipsoids for the other two genotypes through simple
geometric transformations (Figure 2b).

the reference calls.
2.4.1 Missing genotype AA or BB cluster
If genotype AA cluster of a SNP has less than 3 reference calls, SoCal first finds the
ellipsoids for genotype AB and BB clusters, and then estimates that for genotype AA
cluster through simple geometric transformations.
Let EAB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAB qT EAB px ´ cAB q ď 1u and EBB “ tx P ❘n |px ´
cBB qT EBB px ´ cBB q ď 1u be the ellipsoids obtained for genotype AB and BB clusters,
and nAB , nBB the unit vectors pointing in the direction of the major axis of the corresponding ellipsoid. SoCal estimates the center of EAA , the ellipsoid for genotype AA
cluster, by reflecting cBB , the center of EBB , across the major axis of EAB . To estimate
the orientation of EAA , SoCal first determines the angle between nAB and nBB , and then

applies a rotation matrix of that angle on EAB .
Formally, let EAA “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAA qT EAA px ´ cAA q ď 1u be the estimated
ellipsoid for genotype AA cluster, and α the angle between nAB and nBB , then cAA “
´cBB ` 2cAB ` 2nAB ppcBB ´ cAB qT nAB q, and EAA “ RT EAB R, where R is a rotation
matrix of angle α.
If genotype BB cluster is missing, the center and orientation of the ellipsoid for that
cluster is estimated in a similar way. Formally, let EBB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cBB qT EBB px ´
cBB q ď 1u be the estimated ellipsoid for genotype BB cluster, and α the angle between
nAB and nAA , then cBB “ ´cAA `2cAB `2nAB ppcAA ´cAB qT nAB q, and EBB “ RT EAB R,
where R is a rotation matrix of angle ´α.
2.4.2 Missing genotype AB cluster
Although SNPs with genotype AB cluster missing were not observed in HapMap
reference genotype calls, for completeness, for these SNPs SoCal first obtains, EAA and
EBB , the ellipsoids for genotype AA and BB cluster, and then estimates the center of
EAB , the ellipsoid for the missing cluster, using the mid-point between the centers of
EAA and EBB . The orientation of EAB is obtained by applying a rotation to the ellipsoid
with the minimum volume among EAA and EBB .
Formally, let EAB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAB qT EAB px ´ cAB q ď 1u be the estimated
ellipsoid for genotype AB cluster, and α the angle between nAA and nBB , then cAB “
ˆ
ˆ is the matrix of the ellipsoid with the
pcAA ` cBB q{2, and EAB “ RT ER,
where E
minimum volumne among EAA and EBB , and R a rotation matrix of angle ˘α{2. The
sign of the angle of rotation is dependent on the choise of ellipsoid on which rotation is
applied—positive for EAA and negative for EBB .

2.5 Genotype calling
After the ellipsoidal decision regions, Eg “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q ď 1u, @g P
tAA, AB, BBu of a SNP are obtained, SoCal uses them to classify SNPs with unknown
genotypes using minimum distance classification.
a If a sample has allele intensity θA and θB at SNP n, SoCal first computes Dg “
px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q, where x “ plogpθA q, logpθB qq, for each g P tAA, AB, BBu. SoCal
then calls the genotype, G, of that sample at SNP n as the genotype having the minimum
Dg , that is, G “ arg mingPtAA,AB,BBu Dg .
SoCal defines λ “ 1 ´ DG {pDAA ` DAB ` DBB q to quantify the confidence of each
genotype call. By increasing the threshold for λ, SoCal can achieve higher call accuracy
at the cost of decreasing call rate.

From the 16,387 SNPs, 4,064 SNPs with two genotype clusters having less than 3
reference genotype calls were further removed from the microarry. Among these SNPs,
3,596 are monomorphic SNPs. In total, 12,323 SNPs were left for evaluation. On average,
each of these SNPs has 83 reference genotype calls.

4 Results
4.1 Cross-validation with HapMap reference calls
To evaluate the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls made by SoCal
with the reference calls from HapMap through leave-one-out cross-validation. For each
SNP, I used one sample from the reference set as validation data and the rest as training
data. I repeated this process until all the samples in the reference set were used as
validation data exactly once.
First, I compared the accuracy of SoCal under different choices of βi , which are
the weights assigned to the criteria of finding the ellipsoidal decision regions for each
genotype cluster. Figure 4 shows the concordance rate of SoCal in the leave-one-out
cross-validation for a wide range of call rates when different values of βi were used.
Because the choice of weights, β1 “ 1, β2 “ 104 , β3 “ 102 , had the highest call rate

at fixed concordance rates, it’s set to be the default choice of SoCal. And all future
experiments presented in this article used this choice of weights.

4.2 Comparison with CRLMM calls
As another way of evaluating the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls
made by SoCal and those made by CRLMM, a widely used state-of-the-art genotype
calling method for SNP microarrays.
I first trained SoCal using all the samples with HapMap reference calls, and then
I made genotype calls on the rest of the samples not in the reference set. I excluded
the training samples when comparing SoCal with CRLMM, and compared these two
methods only at samples not in the training samples.
Table 3 shows detailed comparison between SoCal and CRLMM at a call rate of
100%. In total, SoCal made 2,245,891 calls, out of which 2,134,868 were concordant with
those made by CRLMM, achieving a concordance rate of 95.10%. The high concordance
rate between SoCal and CRLMM implies that SoCal has the potential to become an
alternative genotype caller.

4.3 Comparison with RLMM in the presence of outliers
I investigated how robust SoCal is when there are outliers in the training data. For
comparison, I implemented the RLMM algorithm, which independently fits bivariate
Gaussian distributions on the log transformed allele intensities of each genotype cluster
and then classifies SNPs with unknown genotype into the distribution having minimum
Mahalanobis distance.
For accurate comparison, I selected a subset of 3,442 SNPs that have more than
10 reference calls for each of the genotype cluster from the set of 12,323 SNPs used for
evaluation in the previous section. To simulate outliers, for each SNP, I first estimated
µg , the mean of the log transformed allele intensities of each genotype cluster, and then
drew one outlier for each genotype cluster from the Gaussian distribution N pµg , γIq,

8

Huwenbo Shi (603-778-363) shihuwenbo@ucla.edu

4

RESULTS

where I is the identity matrix and γ a positive constant controlling the variance of the
distribution—by increasing γ, one increases the effect of outliers. In total, I simulated 3
outliers for each SNP, one for each genotype cluster.
As an example, Figure 5 shows the ellipsoidal decision regions obtained by SoCal and
the level curves of the Gaussian decision regions obtained by RLMM before and after
an outlier is introduced to the genotype AA cluster. Before an outlier is introduced,
both SoCal and RLMM can make accurate genotype calls. However, after an outlier is
introduced into the genotype AA cluster, the variance of the Gaussian decision region
obtained by RLMM is significantly affected, making the classificatoin much less accurate.
On the other hand, because SoCal not only puts penalty on outliers but also jointly uses
data from other genotype clusters to form the decision region, it can still classify most
SNPs into correct genotypes.

decreases much more slowly than does the RLMM method. Thus, SoCal is in general
more robust to outliers than RLMM.

4.4 Software implementation
SoCal is implemented in Python. To solve the conic programming problem of finding
separating ellipsoids, SoCal uses CVXOPT. Source code of SoCal is available at https:
//github.com/huwenboshi/wqe/tree/master/genotype_caller.

5 Discussion
I have presented SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for Affymetrix SNP
microarray. Unlike many existing supervised genotype calling algorithms that try to fit
generative models (mostly Gaussian mixture models) on summarized allele intensities
with reference genotype calls, SoCal uses these data to efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision
regions for each genotype cluster by solving a conic programming problem. Both crossvalidation of SoCal with HapMap reference calls and comparison with genotype calls
made by CRLMM show that SoCal is comparable in accuracy to many of the state-ofthe-art genotype calling methods. Also, when there are outliers in training data, SoCal
outperforms RLMM, a genotype calling method that uses Gaussian decision regions to
call genotypes, demonstrating the robustness of SoCal in the presence of outliers over
existing methods. Overall, SoCal proves to be a promising alternative genotype caller
for Affymetrix SNP microarray.
Like many supervised genotype callers, SoCal has its limitations. First, SoCal is
not directly applicable to SNP microarrays that don’t have reference genotype calls.
Second, SoCal is, in general, also not directly applicable to the same SNP microarray

11

References

across different laboratories because different laboratory protocols can generate different
allele intensities for even the same SNP microarray. In these scenarios, one can first call
genotypes from microarrays using unsupervised genotype calling algorithms. One can
then use these calls as training data for SoCal and use SoCal to form refined ellipsoidal
decision regions for each genotype cluster. Because SoCal is robust to outliers in the
training data, the refined ellipsoidal decision regions can be used to accurately call
genotypes for future SNPs. Another limitation of SoCal is that users need to fine tune
the weights (βi ) assigned to the criteria of finding the ellipsoids. However, experiments
with SoCal show that SoCal is mostly sensitive to the choice of β2 and β3 . And optimal
values for parameters can be estimated efficiently through experiments.
SoCal is still in development, and can be improved and extended in many directions. First, the current method that SoCal uses to handle SNPs with missing genotype
clusters is through simple and fixed geometric transformations. This method assumes
that genotype AA cluter and genotype BB cluster are symmetric around genotype AB
cluster. However, this is not true in general. Future efforts should be spent on how to estimate ellipsoids for missing genotype clusters more accurately. Second, currently SoCal
only uses allele intensities data for reference genotype calls. However, allele intensities
data for samples having structual variations is also available. A possible improvement
for SoCal is to include these data in finding the ellipsoids for each genotype cluster to
further refine the decision regions. These refined decision regions can then be used to
detect possible structural variations.
To summarize, SoCal presents a novel and promising method for genotype calling.
It’s efficient in that it finds decision regions by solving a conic programming problem,
which is solvable in polynomial time with guaranteed global optimum. SoCal is comparable in accuracy with many state-of-the-art methods. Although SoCal has its limitations,
these limitations are also present in other supervised genotype callers, and have been
addressed previously. SoCal can also be extended and improved to be more accurate
and to have more functionality.
