SoCal: supervised genotype calling via ellipsoid separation for
A↵ymetrix SNP microarray
Huwenbo Shi (603-778-363) shihuwenbo@ucla.edu

ABSTRACT
Genotype calling for SNP microarray is an important step in array-based association studies. Traditional supervised genotype calling algorithms for SNP microarray fit generative
models (mostly Gaussian mixture models) on allele intensities of samples having reference
genotype calls. In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling method that
efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype cluster via ellipsoid separation. By specifying di↵erent weights to the criteria of finding separating ellipsoids, SoCal
can control the e↵ect of outliers in training data. In leave-one-out cross-validation with
HapMap reference calls, SoCal achieved a concordance rate of 99.71% at a call rate of 95%,
comparable to many state-of-the-art methods. By training SoCal using HapMap reference
calls, SoCal achieved 95.10% concordance rate with the genotype calls made by CRLMM
at a call rate of 100% on a set of samples excluding the training samples. SoCal also shows
more robustness than RLMM, a method that forms Gaussian decision regions from training
data to call genotypes, when there are outliers in the training data. SoCal proves to be a
novel and promising alternative genotype caller.

1 Introduction
Accurate genotyping of SNPs is essential to discovering true signals in association studies. Although
next generation sequencing technology provides cheap whole-genome sequences for genotyping SNPs,
SNP microarray is still a cost-e↵ective genotyping technology for many specific association studies. In
an A↵ymetrix SNP microarray, oligonucleotide probes are used to match and bind DNA fragments
containing biallelic SNPs. Then a fluorescence scanner scans the microarray to quantify perfect match
and mismatch of these fragments. Most genotype calling procedures for SNP microarray consists of two
steps. In the first step, raw information from microarray is summarized to obtain the intensities, ✓A
and ✓B , of the two alleles, denoted by A and B, of each SNP. In the second step, SNPs are classified into
genotype AA, AB, or BB based on the allele intensities they generate. The focus of this article is on the
second step of the genotype calling procedure—genotype calling using summarized allele intensities.
For a specific SNP, if a sample has genotype AA or BB, the allele intensity, ✓A or ✓B , will be
higher respectively. If a sample has genotype AB, the intensities, ✓A and ✓B , will be similar. If one
plots logp✓A q versus logp✓B q of a SNP for a number of samples, normally 3 ellipsoidal clusters can be
observed, one for each genotype, as shown in Figure 1. Many genotype calling algorithms use modelbased unsupervised clustering to identify these clusters and then assign genotypes to each cluster.
Although these methods are applicable to a wide range of microarrays, they don’t take advantage
of genotype calls that are already available. Also, these methods use the EM algorithm to estimate
model parameters, which is sensitive to starting parameters and slow to converge. To utilize reference
genotype calls, Rabbee et al. proposed the RLMM algorithm, a supervised genotype calling method
that uses reference genotype calls to form decision regions by fitting bivariate Gaussian distributions
on observed allele intensities for each genotype. These Gaussian decision regions are then used to call
SNPs with unknown genotype. However, fitting a Gaussian distribution is known to be sensitive to
outliers, which, for SNP microarrays, can be caused by genomic structural variations.

In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for A↵ymetrix SNP microarrays. Instead of fitting Gaussian distributions on allele intensities with reference genotype calls,
SoCal efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype of a SNP by solving a conic programming problem. SoCal can control the e↵ect of outliers by assigning di↵erent weights to each of the
criteria for finding the ellipsoids—separation ratio, ellipsoid volume, and number of enclosed points.
After SoCal finds the ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype of a SNP, it uses them to call the
same SNP with unknown genotype.
Using reference genotype calls from the HapMap Project as training and validation data, SoCal
achieved 99.71% accuracy at a call rate of 95% during leave-one-out cross-validation. Furthermore,
SoCal shows more robustness than the RLMM method when there are outliers in the training data.

2 Methods
2.1 Overview of SoCal’s genotype calling procedure
SNP allele intensities are first summarized from raw microarray data using SNPRMA, which removes non-biological e↵ect from the data. After this step, SoCal calls genotypes in two steps. In the
first step, SoCal finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each of the genotype of a SNP using reference
genotype calls. In the second step, SoCal classifies SNPs with unknown genotypes using minimum
distance classification.

2.2 Pattern separation by ellipsoid
An ellipsoid E Ñ n can be expressed as E “ tx P n |px ´ cqT Epx ´ cq § 1u, where c is the center
of the ellipsoid, and E a positive definite matrix denoting the shape and orientation of the ellipsoid. Let
tai u be the points to be included in an ellipsoid, and tbj u be the points to be excluded, the problem of
ellipsoidal separation is to find c and E such that pai ´cqT Epai ´cq § 1 @i and pbj ´cqT Epbj ´cq ° 1 @j.

2.3 Forming ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype
Let G “ tAA, AB, BBu be the set of genotypes of a SNP, and JAA , JAB , JBB the index set of
samples with the corresponding genotype. Let X “ tplogp✓A q, logp✓B qqi |i “ 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , |JAA |`|JAB |`|JBB |u

If a SNP has moderate minor allele frequency (MAF), the genotype clusters of that SNP are well
defined, and SoCal obtains three ellipsoidal decision regions for that SNP, one for each genotype (Figure
2a). However, if a SNP has lower MAF, some genotype cluster may not be well defined. For these
SNPs, SoCal estimates the ellipsoid for the missing genotype cluster using the ellipsoids for the other
two genotypes through simple geometric transformations (Figure 2b).

2.4.1 Missing genotype AA or BB cluster
If genotype AA cluster of a SNP has less than 3 reference calls, SoCal first finds the ellipsoids
for genotype AB and BB clusters, and then estimates that for genotype AA cluster through simple
geometric transformations.
Let EAB “ tx P n |px´cAB qT EAB px´cAB q § 1u and EBB “ tx P n |px´cBB qT EBB px´cBB q § 1u
be the ellipsoids obtained for genotype AB and BB clusters, and nAB , nBB the unit vectors pointing

MATERIALS

in the direction of the major axis of the corresponding ellipsoid. SoCal estimates the center of EAA , the
ellipsoid for genotype AA cluster, by reflecting cBB , the center of EBB , across the major axis of EAB .
To estimate the orientation of EAA , SoCal first determines the angle between nAB and nBB , and then
applies a rotation matrix of that angle on EAB .
Formally, let EAA “ tx P n |px ´ cAA qT EAA px ´ cAA q § 1u be the estimated ellipsoid for genotype
AA cluster, and ↵ the angle between nAB and nBB , then cAA “ ´cBB `2cAB `2nAB ppcBB ´cAB qT nAB q,
and EAA “ RT EAB R, where R is a rotation matrix of angle ↵.
If genotype BB cluster is missing, the center and orientation of the ellipsoid for that cluster is
estimated in a similar way. Formally, let EBB “ tx P n |px ´ cBB qT EBB px ´ cBB q § 1u be the
estimated ellipsoid for genotype BB cluster, and ↵ the angle between nAB and nAA , then cBB “
´cAA ` 2cAB ` 2nAB ppcAA ´ cAB qT nAB q, and EBB “ RT EAB R, where R is a rotation matrix of angle
´↵.
2.4.2 Missing genotype AB cluster
Although SNPs with genotype AB cluster missing were not observed in HapMap reference genotype
calls, for completeness, for these SNPs SoCal first obtains, EAA and EBB , the ellipsoids for genotype
AA and BB cluster, and then estimates the center of EAB , the ellipsoid for the missing cluster, using
the mid-point between the centers of EAA and EBB . The orientation of EAB is obtained by applying a
rotation to the ellipsoid with the minimum volume among EAA and EBB .
Formally, let EAB “ tx P n |px ´ cAB qT EAB px ´ cAB q § 1u be the estimated ellipsoid for genotype
ˆ
AB cluster, and ↵ the angle between nAA and nBB , then cAB “ pcAA ` cBB q{2, and EAB “ RT ER,
ˆ
where E is the matrix of the ellipsoid with the minimum volumne among EAA and EBB , and R a
rotation matrix of angle ˘↵{2. The sign of the angle of rotation is dependent on the choise of ellipsoid
on which rotation is applied—positive for EAA and negative for EBB .

2.5 Genotype calling
After the ellipsoidal decision regions, Eg “ tx P n |px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q § 1u, @g P tAA, AB, BBu
of a SNP are obtained, SoCal uses them to classify SNPs with unknown genotypes using minimum

If a sample has allele intensity ✓A and ✓B at SNP n, SoCal first computes Dg “ px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q,
where x “ plogp✓A q, logp✓B qq, for each g P tAA, AB, BBu. SoCal then calls the genotype, G, of that
sample at SNP n as the genotype having the minimum Dg , that is, G “ arg mingPtAA,AB,BBu Dg .
SoCal defines “ 1 ´ DG {pDAA ` DAB ` DBB q to quantify the confidence of each genotype call.
By increasing the threshold for , SoCal can achieve higher call accuracy at the cost of decreasing call
rate.

3 Materials
The microarray used for evaluation in this project was the A↵ymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping
50K Xba Array, which contains 58,960 SNPs. Raw microarray data for 270 samples was obtained from
HapMap FTP. And reference genotype calls were obtained from HapMap using HapMart.
After removing strand-ambiguous SNPs and SNPs not present on HapMart from the microarry,
16,387 SNPs were left. Figure 3 shows the minor allele frequency distribution for these SNPs.

From the 16,387 SNPs, 4,064 SNPs with two genotype clusters having less than 3 reference genotype
calls were further removed from the microarry. Among these SNPs, 3,596 are monomorphic SNPs. In
total, 12,323 SNPs were left for evaluation. On average, each of these SNPs has 83 reference genotype
calls.

4 Results
4.1 Cross-validation with HapMap reference calls
To evaluate the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls made by SoCal with the reference
calls from HapMap through leave-one-out cross-validation. For each SNP, I used one sample from the
reference set as validation data and the rest as training data. I repeated this process until all the
samples in the reference set were used as validation data exactly once.
First, I compared the accuracy of SoCal under di↵erent choices of i , which are the weights assigned
to the criteria of finding the ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype cluster. Figure 4 shows the
concordance rate of SoCal in the leave-one-out cross-validation for a wide range of call rates when
di↵erent values of i were used. Because the choice of weights, 1 “ 1, 2 “ 104 , 3 “ 102 , had the
highest call rate at fixed concordance rates, it’s set to be the default choice of SoCal. And all future
experiments presented in this article used this choice of weights.

4.2 Comparison with CRLMM calls
As another way of evaluating the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls made by
SoCal and those made by CRLMM, a widely used state-of-the-art genotype calling method for SNP
microarrays.
I first trained SoCal using all the samples with HapMap reference calls, and then I made genotype
calls on the rest of the samples not in the reference set. I excluded the training samples when comparing
SoCal with CRLMM, and compared these two methods only at samples not in the training samples.
Table 3 shows detailed comparison between SoCal and CRLMM at a call rate of 100%. In total,
SoCal made 2,245,891 calls, out of which 2,134,868 were concordant with those made by CRLMM,

achieving a concordance rate of 95.10%. The high concordance rate between SoCal and CRLMM

4.3 Comparison with RLMM in the presence of outliers
I investigated how robust SoCal is when there are outliers in the training data. For comparison, I
implemented the RLMM algorithm, which independently fits bivariate Gaussian distributions on the log
transformed allele intensities of each genotype cluster and then classifies SNPs with unknown genotype
into the distribution having minimum Mahalanobis distance.
For accurate comparison, I selected a subset of 3,442 SNPs that have more than 10 reference
calls for each of the genotype cluster from the set of 12,323 SNPs used for evaluation in the previous
section. To simulate outliers, for each SNP, I first estimated µg , the mean of the log transformed
allele intensities of each genotype cluster, and then drew one outlier for each genotype cluster from the
Gaussian distribution N pµg , Iq, where I is the identity matrix and a positive constant controlling the
variance of the distribution—by increasing , one increases the e↵ect of outliers. In total, I simulated
3 outliers for each SNP, one for each genotype cluster.
As an example, Figure 5 shows the ellipsoidal decision regions obtained by SoCal and the level
curves of the Gaussian decision regions obtained by RLMM before and after an outlier is introduced to
the genotype AA cluster. Before an outlier is introduced, both SoCal and RLMM can make accurate
genotype calls. However, after an outlier is introduced into the genotype AA cluster, the variance of the
Gaussian decision region obtained by RLMM is significantly a↵ected, making the classificatoin much
less accurate. On the other hand, because SoCal not only puts penalty on outliers but also jointly
uses data from other genotype clusters to form the decision region, it can still classify most SNPs into
correct genotypes.

RLMM method. Thus, SoCal is in general more robust to outliers than RLMM.

4.4 Software implementation
SoCal is implemented in Python. To solve the conic programming problem of finding separating ellipsoids, SoCal uses CVXOPT. Source code of SoCal is available at https://github.com/huwenboshi/
wqe/tree/master/genotype_caller.

5 Discussion
I have presented SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for A↵ymetrix SNP microarray.
Unlike many existing supervised genotype calling algorithms that try to fit generative models (mostly
Gaussian mixture models) on summarized allele intensities with reference genotype calls, SoCal uses
these data to efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype cluster by solving a conic
programming problem. Both cross-validation of SoCal with HapMap reference calls and comparison
with genotype calls made by CRLMM show that SoCal is comparable in accuracy to many of the stateof-the-art genotype calling methods. Also, when there are outliers in training data, SoCal outperforms
RLMM, a genotype calling method that uses Gaussian decision regions to call genotypes, demonstrating
the robustness of SoCal in the presence of outliers over existing methods. Overall, SoCal proves to be
a promising alternative genotype caller for A↵ymetrix SNP microarray.
Like many supervised genotype callers, SoCal has its limitations. First, SoCal is not directly
applicable to SNP microarrays that don’t have reference genotype calls. Second, SoCal is, in general,
also not directly applicable to the same SNP microarray across di↵erent laboratories because di↵erent
laboratory protocols can generate di↵erent allele intensities for even the same SNP microarray. In these
scenarios, one can first call genotypes from microarrays using unsupervised genotype calling algorithms.
One can then use these calls as training data for SoCal and use SoCal to form refined ellipsoidal decision
regions for each genotype cluster. Because SoCal is robust to outliers in the training data, the refined
ellipsoidal decision regions can be used to accurately call genotypes for future SNPs. Another limitation
of SoCal is that users need to fine tune the weights ( i ) assigned to the criteria of finding the ellipsoids.
However, experiments with SoCal show that SoCal is mostly sensitive to the choice of 2 and 3 . And
optimal values for parameters can be estimated efficiently through experiments.
SoCal is still in development, and can be improved and extended in many directions. First, the
current method that SoCal uses to handle SNPs with missing genotype clusters is through simple and
fixed geometric transformations. This method assumes that genotype AA cluter and genotype BB
cluster are symmetric around genotype AB cluster. However, this is not true in general. Future e↵orts

should be spent on how to estimate ellipsoids for missing genotype clusters more accurately. Second,
currently SoCal only uses allele intensities data for reference genotype calls. However, allele intensities
data for samples having structual variations is also available. A possible improvement for SoCal is
to include these data in finding the ellipsoids for each genotype cluster to further refine the decision
regions. These refined decision regions can then be used to detect possible structural variations.
To summarize, SoCal presents a novel and promising method for genotype calling. It’s efficient in
that it finds decision regions by solving a conic programming problem, which is solvable in polynomial
time with guaranteed global optimum. SoCal is comparable in accuracy with many state-of-the-art
methods. Although SoCal has its limitations, these limitations are also present in other supervised
genotype callers, and have been addressed previously. SoCal can also be extended and improved to be
more accurate and to have more functionality.
