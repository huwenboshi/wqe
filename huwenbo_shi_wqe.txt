SoCal: supervised genotype calling via ellipsoidal
separation for Affymetrix SNP microarray
Huwenbo Shi (603-778-363) shihuwenbo@ucla.edu

Abstract
Background: Genotype calling for SNP microarray is an important step in
array-based association studies. Most supervised genotype calling methods
for SNP microarray fit generative models (e.g. Gaussian models) on logtransformed allele intensities of SNPs from samples having reference genotype calls.
Methods: In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling
method that efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype
via ellipsoidal separation instead of fitting a generative model. By assigning
different weights to the criteria of finding separating ellipsoids, SoCal can
control the effect of outliers in training data.
Results: In leave-one-out cross-validation with HapMap reference calls, SoCal achieved a concordance rate of 98.94% at a call rate of 100% and 99.71%
at a call rate of 95%, comparable to many state-of-the-art methods. After
being trained using HapMap reference calls, SoCal achieved a concordance
rate of 95.10% with genotype calls made by CRLMM at a call rate of 100%
on a set of validation calls excluding the training calls. SoCal also shows
more robustness than RLMM, a supervised method that uses Gaussian decision regions to call genotypes, when outliers are present in training data.
Overall, SoCal is a novel and promising genotype calling method.

1 Introduction
Accurate genotyping of SNPs is essential to discovering true causal variants in association studies [1]. Although next generation sequencing technology provides cheap
whole-genome sequences for genotyping SNPs, SNP microarray is still a cost-effective
genotyping technology for many specific association studies [2]. In an Affymetrix SNP
microarray, oligonucleotide probes are used to match and bind DNA fragments containing biallelic SNPs. Then a fluorescence scanner scans the microarray to quantify
perfect match and mismatch for these fragments. Most genotype calling procedures for
Affymetrix SNP microarray consist of two steps. In the first step, raw information from
microarray is summarized to obtain the intensities, θA and θB , of the two alleles, denoted
by A and B, of each SNP. In the second step, SNPs are classified into genotype AA,
AB, or BB based on the allele intensities they generate. The focus of this article is on
the second step of the genotype calling procedure—genotype calling using summarized
allele intensities.

INTRODUCTION

For a specific SNP, if a sample has genotype AA or BB, the allele intensity, θA or
θB , will be higher respectively. If a sample has genotype AB, the intensities, θA and
θB , will be similar. If one plots logpθA q versus logpθB q of a SNP for a number of samples, normally 3 ellipsoidal clusters can be observed, one for each genotype, as shown
in Figure 1. Many genotype calling algorithms use model-based unsupervised clustering
to identify these clusters and then assign genotypes to each cluster [3, 4, 5]. Although
these methods are applicable to a wide range of microarrays because they only require
information from microarrays, they don’t take advantage of genotype calls that are already available. Also, these methods use EM algorithm to estimate model parameters,
which is sensitive to starting parameters and slow to converge [6]. To utilize reference
genotype calls, Rabbee and Speed proposed the RLMM algorithm, a supervised genotype calling method that forms decision regions for each genotype by fitting bivariate
Gaussian distributions on log-transformed allele intensities with reference genotype calls
[7]. These Gaussian decision regions are then used to call SNPs for samples with unknown genotypes. However, fitting a Gaussian distribution is known to be non-robust
to outliers [8]. And for SNP microarrays, outliers can be caused by genomic structural
variations [9].

two alleles of a SNP for a number of samples. Each point in the plot represents
a sample.
In this article, I present SoCal, a supervised genotype calling method for Affymetrix
SNP microarray. Instead of fitting Gaussian distributions on log-transformed allele intensities with reference genotype calls, SoCal efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision regions
for each genotype via ellipsoidal separation by solving a conic programming problem.
SoCal can control the effect of outliers by assigning different weights to the criteria of
finding separating ellipsoids—separation ratio, ellipsoid volume, and number of enclosed
points. After SoCal finds the ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype, it uses them
to call SNPs for samples with unknown genotypes using minimum distance classification.

data, SoCal achieved a concordance rate of 98.94% at a call rate of 100% and 99.71% at
a call rate of 95% in leave-one-out cross-validation. Furthermore, SoCal showed more
robustness than the RLMM method when outliers were present in training data.

2 Methods
2.1 Overview of SoCal’s genotype calling procedure
SNP allele intensities are first normalized and summarized from raw microarray
data using RMA method, an important preprocessing step that reduces cross-chip and
cross-lab non-biological effects from raw data [10, 11]. After the preprocessing step,
SoCal calls genotypes in two steps. In the first step, SoCal finds ellipsoidal decision
regions for each genotype of a SNP using reference genotype calls. In the second step,
SoCal uses these ellipsoidal decision regions to call SNPs for samples with unknown
genotypes through minimum distance classification.
In this section, I first introduce the problem of pattern separation by ellipsoid. Then
I describe how SoCal finds ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype and then calls
genotypes using these ellipsoidal decision regions.

2.2 Pattern separation by ellipsoid
An ellipsoid E Ď ❘n can be expressed as E “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cqT Epx ´ cq ď 1u, where
c is the center of the ellipsoid, and E a positive definite matrix denoting the shape and
orientation of the ellipsoid. Let tai u be the points to be included in an ellipsoid, and
tbj u be the points to be excluded, the problem of ellipsoidal separation is to find c and
E such that pai ´ cqT Epai ´ cq ď 1 @i and pbj ´ cqT Epbj ´ cq ą 1 @j.

2.3 Forming ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype
Let G “ tAA, AB, BBu be the set of genotypes of SNP n, and JAA , JAB , JBB the
index set of samples with the corresponding genotype. Let X “ tplogpθA q, logpθB qqi |i “
1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , |JAA | ` |JAB | ` |JBB |u be the set of log-transformed allele intensities of all the
samples, and XAA “ txj |xj P X, j P JAA u, XAB “ txj |xj P X, j P JAB u, XBB “
txj |xj P X, j P JBB u the set of log-transformed allele intensities from samples having
the corresponding genotype for SNP n.
To find the ellipsoid that includes XAA and excludes XAB Y XBB , one sets tai u “
XAA and tbj u “ XAB Y XBB , and solves the following conic programming problem.

inclusion of points. By increasing β2 , one finds ellipsoid with smaller volume. And by
increasing β3 , one finds ellipsoid that tries to include more data points. In SoCal, default

If a SNP has moderate minor allele frequency (MAF), the genotype clusters of
that SNP are well defined, and SoCal obtains three ellipsoidal decision regions for that
SNP, one for each genotype cluster (Figure 2a). However, if a SNP has lower MAF,
some genotype cluster may be sparse or missing. For these SNPs, SoCal estimates the
ellipsoid for the sparse or missing genotype cluster using the ellipsoids for the other two
genotypes through simple geometric transformations (Figure 2b).

MATERIALS

Let EAB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAB qT EAB px ´ cAB q ď 1u and EBB “ tx P ❘n |px ´
cBB qT EBB px ´ cBB q ď 1u be the ellipsoids obtained for genotype AB and BB clusters,
and nAB , nBB the unit vectors pointing in the direction of the major axis of the corresponding ellipsoid. SoCal estimates the center of EAA , the ellipsoid for genotype AA
cluster, by reflecting cBB , the center of EBB , across the major axis of EAB . To estimate
the orientation of EAA , SoCal first determines the angle between nAB and nBB , and
then applies a rotation matrix of that angle on EAB .
Formally, let EAA “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAA qT EAA px ´ cAA q ď 1u be the estimated
ellipsoid for genotype AA cluster, and α the angle between nAB and nBB , then cAA “
´cBB ` 2cAB ` 2nAB ppcBB ´ cAB qT nAB q, and EAA “ RT EAB R, where R is a rotation
matrix of angle α.
If genotype BB cluster is missing, the center and orientation of the ellipsoid for that
cluster is estimated in a similar way. Formally, let EBB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cBB qT EBB px ´
cBB q ď 1u be the estimated ellipsoid for genotype BB cluster, and α the angle between nAB and nAA , then cBB “ ´cAA ` 2cAB ` 2nAB ppcAA ´ cAB qT nAB q, and EBB “
RT EAB R, where R is a rotation matrix of angle ´α.
2.4.2 Missing genotype AB cluster
Although SNPs with genotype AB cluster missing were not observed in HapMap
reference genotype calls, for completeness, for these SNPs SoCal first obtains, EAA and
EBB , the ellipsoids for genotype AA and BB cluster, and then estimates the center of
EAB , the ellipsoid for the missing cluster, using the mid-point between the centers of
EAA and EBB . The orientation of EAB is obtained by applying a rotation to the ellipsoid
with the minimum volume among EAA and EBB .
Formally, let EAB “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cAB qT EAB px ´ cAB q ď 1u be the estimated
ellipsoid for genotype AB cluster, and α the angle between nAA and nBB , then cAB “
ˆ
ˆ is the matrix of the ellipsoid with the
pcAA ` cBB q{2, and EAB “ RT ER,
where E
minimum volumne among EAA and EBB , and R a rotation matrix of angle ˘α{2. The
sign of the angle of rotation is dependent on the choise of ellipsoid on which rotation is
applied—positive for EAA and negative for EBB .

2.5 Genotype calling
After the ellipsoidal decision regions, Eg “ tx P ❘n |px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q ď 1u, @g P
tAA, AB, BBu of a SNP are obtained, SoCal uses them to classify SNPs with unknown
genotypes using minimum distance classification.
a If a sample has allele intensities θA and θB at SNP n, SoCal first computes Dg “
px ´ cg qT Eg px ´ cg q, where x “ plogpθA q, logpθB qq, for each g P tAA, AB, BBu. SoCal
then calls the genotype, G, of that sample at SNP n as the genotype having minimum
Dg , that is, G “ arg mingPtAA,AB,BBu Dg .
SoCal defines λ “ 1 ´ DG {pDAA ` DAB ` DBB q to quantify the confidence of each
genotype call. By increasing the threshold for λ, SoCal can achieve higher call accuracy
at the cost of decreasing call rate.

From the 16,387 SNPs, 4,064 SNPs with two genotype clusters having less than 3
reference genotype calls were further removed. Among these SNPs, 3,596 are monomorphic SNPs with MAF equal to 0. In total, 12,323 SNPs were left for evaluation. On
average, each of these SNPs has 83 reference genotype calls.

4 Results
4.1 Cross-validation with HapMap reference calls
To evaluate the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls made by SoCal
with the reference calls from HapMap through leave-one-out cross-validation. For each
SNP, I used one sample from the reference set as validation data and the rest as training
data. I repeated this process until all the samples in the reference set were used as
validation data exactly once.
First, I compared the accuracy of SoCal under different choices of βi , the weights
assigned to the criteria of finding ellipsoidal decision regions for each genotype cluster.
Figure 4 shows the concordance rate of SoCal in the leave-one-out cross-validation at a
wide range of call rates for different values of βi . Because the weights, β1 “ 1, β2 “ 104 ,
β3 “ 102 , had the highest call rates at fixed concordance rates, they are set to be the
default of SoCal. And all future experiments presented in this article used this choice
of weights.

4.2 Comparison with CRLMM calls
As another way of evaluating the accuracy of SoCal, I compared the genotype calls
made by SoCal and those made by CRLMM, a state-of-the-art supervised genotype
calling method for SNP microarrays that uses a two-level hierarchical model to model
variations in log-transformed allele intensities across SNPs and across chips [11].
I first trained SoCal using all the samples with HapMap reference calls, and then
made genotype calls on the rest of the samples. When comparing SoCal with CRLMM,
I excluded the training samples and compared these two methods only at samples not
in the training samples.
Table 3 shows detailed comparison between SoCal and CRLMM at a call rate of
100%. In total, SoCal made 2,245,891 calls, out of which 2,134,868 were concordant with
those made by CRLMM, achieving a concordance rate of 95.10%. The high concordance
rate between SoCal and CRLMM suggests that SoCal has the potential to become an
alternative genotype caller.

4.3 Comparison with RLMM in the presence of outliers
I investigated how robust SoCal is when outliers are present in training data. For
comparison, I implemented the RLMM algorithm, which fits bivariate Gaussian distributions on log-transformed allele intensities of each genotype cluster and then classifies
SNPs with unknown genotype into the distribution having minimum Mahalanobis distance based on the allele intensities they generate [7].
For accurate comparison, I selected a subset of 3,442 SNPs that have more than 10
reference calls for each genotype cluster from the set of 12,323 SNPs used for evaluation
in previous experiments. To simulate outliers, for each SNP, I first estimated µg , the
mean of log-transformed allele intensities of each genotype cluster, and then drew one
outlier for each genotype cluster from the Gaussian distribution N pµg , γIq, where I is the
identity matrix and γ a positive constant controlling the variance of the distribution—by
increasing γ, one increases the effect of outliers. In total, I simulated 3 outliers for each
SNP, one for each genotype cluster.
To illustrate the robustness of SoCal and RLMM, Figure 5 shows the ellipsoidal
decision regions obtained by SoCal and the level curves of the Gaussian decision regions
obtained by RLMM before and after an outlier is introduced to the genotype AA cluster.
Before an outlier is introduced, both SoCal and RLMM can find appropriate decision
regions for each genotype cluster and make accurate genotype calls. However, after
an outlier is introduced into the genotype AA cluster, the variance of the Gaussian
decision region obtained by RLMM for the genotype AA cluster is significantly affected,
making genotype calling much less accurate. On the other hand, because SoCal not only
considers outliers but also jointly uses data points from other genotype clusters when
forming the decision regions, the decision region for the genotype AA cluster, although

decreases much more slowly than does the RLMM method. Thus, SoCal is in general
more robust to outliers than RLMM.

4.4 Software implementation
SoCal is implemented in Python. To solve the conic programming problem of finding
separating ellipsoids, SoCal uses CVXOPT [14]. Source code of SoCal is available at
https://github.com/huwenboshi/wqe/tree/master/genotype_caller.

5 Discussion
I have presented SoCal, a supervised genotype calling algorithm for Affymetrix SNP
microarray. Unlike many existing supervised genotype calling algorithms that try to fit
generative models (mostly Gaussian mixture models) on summarized allele intensities
with reference genotype calls, SoCal uses these data to efficiently finds ellipsoidal decision
regions for each genotype cluster by solving a conic programming problem. Both crossvalidation of SoCal with HapMap reference calls and comparison with genotype calls
made by CRLMM show that SoCal is comparable in accuracy to many of the state-ofthe-art genotype calling methods. Also, when there are outliers in training data, SoCal
outperforms RLMM, a genotype calling method that uses Gaussian decision regions to
call genotypes, demonstrating the robustness of SoCal in the presence of outliers over
existing methods. Overall, SoCal proves to be a promising alternative genotype caller
for Affymetrix SNP microarray.
Like many supervised genotype callers, SoCal has its limitations. First, SoCal is
not directly applicable to SNP microarrays that don’t have reference genotype calls.
Second, SoCal is, in general, also not directly applicable to the same SNP microarray
across different laboratories because different laboratory protocols can generate different
allele intensities for even the same SNP microarray. In these scenarios, one can first call
genotypes from microarrays using unsupervised genotype calling algorithms. One can
then use these calls as training data for SoCal and use SoCal to form refined ellipsoidal
decision regions for each genotype cluster. Because SoCal is robust to outliers in the

10

training data, the refined ellipsoidal decision regions can be used to accurately call
genotypes for future SNPs. Another limitation of SoCal is that users need to fine tune
the weights (βi ) assigned to the criteria of finding the ellipsoids. However, experiments
with SoCal show that SoCal is mostly sensitive to the choice of β2 and β3 . And optimal
values for parameters can be estimated efficiently through experiments.
SoCal is still in development, and can be improved and extended in many directions. First, the current method that SoCal uses to handle SNPs with missing genotype
clusters is through simple and fixed geometric transformations. This method assumes
that genotype AA cluter and genotype BB cluster are symmetric around genotype AB
cluster. However, this is not true in general. Future efforts should be spent on how to estimate ellipsoids for missing genotype clusters more accurately. Second, currently SoCal
only uses allele intensities data for reference genotype calls. However, allele intensities
data for samples having structual variations is also available. A possible improvement
for SoCal is to include these data in finding the ellipsoids for each genotype cluster to
further refine the decision regions. These refined decision regions can then be used to
detect possible structural variations.
To summarize, SoCal presents a novel and promising method for genotype calling.
It’s efficient in that it finds decision regions by solving a conic programming problem,
which is solvable in polynomial time with guaranteed global optimum. SoCal is comparable in accuracy with many state-of-the-art methods. Although SoCal has its limitations,
these limitations are also present in other supervised genotype callers, and have been
addressed previously. SoCal can also be extended and improved to be more accurate
and to have more functionality.
